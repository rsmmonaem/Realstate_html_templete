            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why do I need a real estate agent?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Notice that we don’t ask “do I”, but “Why do I”. This leaves people no out. Even phrasing the question this way reassures people that this is a service that they need. Now is your chance to elaborate on the why by pointing out all of the things that you do. Namely, focus on how buying and selling properties is your job and you’ve been doing it for years. You can take all the stress off people’s plates, etc. Take this opportunity to sell yourself and your real estate business so that people will get in touch with you without hesitation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How long will it take to sell my property?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">This is often an impossible question to answer, and yet people ask it all the time. They want to know how long they have to wait to move, or how quickly they’ll expect to get their money so that they can pay off their mortgage and start the process of buying a new home. People like timelines and even though you can’t predict the process, you can explain what you’ve seen in the past and what you would expect based on the current market. And then, you can invite them to contact you for a more precise quote by discussing their property and exactly what the sale includes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are “closing costs”?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">The term “closing costs” is vague. A lot of people know that it’s part of buying a house, but they might not understand what all the different fees and costs are for. This is your chance to explain exactly what is included in the closing costs, as well as how much people can expect to spend here. Although it’s different for each sale, you can usually estimate or suggest a percentage of the sale that will go toward closing costs to help people get a better estimate. Again, this is more about being transparent than actually providing a definite answer to the question at hand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How much commission do you charge?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Another question everyone wants to know is what you’re going to charge them. You can feel free to tell them what your commission rate is for being a seller’s agent and a buyer’s agent, and then disclose if there are any discounts, special considerations, or other factors that may affect that rate. Be as transparent as possible and make sure that you offer comparable commission rates for other real estate agents in the area to prove to people that you are on par with the rest but with better service and solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need a home inspection?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Home inspections are not always mandated as a part of the home buying process. Yet, they’re one of the most valuable resources that homeowners have at their fingertips and should be done on every property. It’s important to encourage this for your homeowners, but more important for you to use this particular answer to explain all the perks of having a home inspection. For just a few hundred dollars, in most cases, people can get a detailed look at the house they want to buy and know exactly what they’re getting into. It isn’t necessarily required, but it’s certainly a great way to get peace of mind, even for those who spend upwards of $1,000 on an inspection. It’s still only a fraction of the price of the house and worth every penny for the peace of mind.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need a down payment to buy a house?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">There used to be situations where people could get a mortgage without a down payment. This doesn’t happen as frequently because the mortgage crisis saw a lot of people who ended up in mortgages that they couldn’t pay for because they didn’t have a down payment to prove their ability to pay over time. Today, there are some instances where you can get a lower down payment, but you rarely will find a loan without one. Explain the “why” to your audience and offer to help them find the best option, including one that fits their budget for down payments.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How do I know what I can spend on a home purchase?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Those who are doing it the right way will want to be able to set a budget for home shopping before they begin. Unfortunately, not everyone knows what they can afford, or what they should be willing, to spend on a house. Some experts tell people their mortgage should be 1/3 of their salary or less. Others say you can spend up to half. Still more might suggest as little as ¼ of your income as a mortgage payment. It’s about budgeting and working out what fits the home buyer’s specific circumstances. Explain this to people and then invite them to reach out to you for help figuring out what their price range will be.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How do I know what to list my house for?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Again, this is going to vary on a case-by-case basis. Make sure that you explain to people that you use comps, current market rates, features of the house, and other elements to determine a listing price that is fair and likely to get a good reaction from the buying market. Some people get emotional with pricing and want to sell for a lot more than their home is worth, so it's important to have the property valued and listed by an unbiased third party—which is where you come in. This is another chance to invite them to reach out to you.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What is the selling/buying process like?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">There’s a lot of stress in buying and selling homes, and especially for those who are doing it for the first time. When you answer this question, provide as much insight as you can about how it works. You can even create separate questions for each side of the process if you work as both a buyer’s agent and a seller’s agent. Then, you can also reassure people here that you will be there to help them every step of the way, further solidifying their peace of mind.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How much experience do you have in real estate?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">This is always a good Q&A to include on your website. It gives you a chance to brag a little about your experience and expertise in real estate and show people what you bring to the table. It also shows your audience that you are willing to be transparent and have their best interests in mind because you are open about your career experience. Be sure to include any licensing, professional certifications, or other credentials that you have here, too.</p>
